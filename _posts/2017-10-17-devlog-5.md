No, I'm not a full-fledged engine guy.

I simply can't stand in using a tool that hides so many things to me (despite being light ad unobtrusive such as [Godot](http://godot)). Also, I don't like the feeling I'm writing code for a scripting language I probably won't reuse at all, being a engine-tailored DSL. So, I've been thinkering with [Corona SDK](http://corona) which appears quite interesting to me and it uses *Lua* which I'm confortable with.

> I could also use Love2D, which I already used in the past, but I'm courious in trying a different framework.

I'm definitely not a skilled pixel-artist (for the moment being, at least) so I though of methods to skip some corners and reach a decent and acceptable productivity level. Eventually the choice fell into using *rotoscoping*, which is a peculiar technique that result in a very artistically distinct style (in addition to recalling games that I love very much, such as *Karateka*, *Prince of Persia*, and *Flashback*). As an further simplification, I'm planning to draw actors as simple silhouettes (with very few colors).

Speaking of colors, I've spent quite a while in deciding how to handle this subject. I wanted to adopt a palette with a limited amount of colors, and there a quite a lot of *standard* of them. Among the many, *PICO8* has what I feel as the most vibrant and distinctive one (reminds me of the Armstrad CPC palette, which I liked very much in the Eighties). Paired with the use of silhouettes it should give good results.

> Please note that won't mean I'm not going to use shades of that base colors, expecially in special effects and fragment shaders.

In the meanwhile, I'm fiddling with a minor project that has always been a deside of mine to implement... that is a [Pole Position](http://Pole_Position) inspired racing game. A very simple one, in the league of the original Atari game. This will be the subject of the next devlog entry for sure. :)
