No developer, nowadays, refuses to adapt some kind of source code management facility.

*( a long time has passed since the 3.5&#8243; floppy disk backups )*

I won&#8217;t try to convince you to use <a href="http://git-scm.com/" title="this" target="_blank">this</a> or <a href="http://mercurial.selenic.com" title="that" target="_blank">that</a> revision control program.

I just use <a href="http://git-scm.com/" title="Git" target="_blank">Git</a>. Because it&#8217;s versatile, powerful and supported almost everywhere. It can be somelike cumbersome to use, but <a href="http://www.sourcetreeapp.com" title="SourceTree" target="_blank">Atalassian&#8217;s SourceTree</a> made a successful effort in providing a nice and neat UI.

At some point, however you should seriously consider to adopt a branching model.

Read <a href="http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/" title="A Successful Git Branching Model" target="_blank">this</a> and is should be clear **why**. <img src="http://blog.brainasylum.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />
