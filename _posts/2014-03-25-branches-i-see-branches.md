No developer, nowadays, refuses to adapt some kind of source code management facility.

*( a long time has passed since the 3.5" floppy disk backups )*

I won't try to convince you to use [this][git] or [that][mercurial] revision control program.

I just use [Git][git]. Because it's versatile, powerful and supported almost everywhere. It can be somelike cumbersome to use, but [Atalassian's SourceTree][sourcetree] made a successful effort in providing a nice and neat UI.

At some point, however you should seriously consider to adopt a branching model.

Read [this][git-flow] and is should be clear **why**.

--- EDIT 2017-03-07 ---

Since some time I'm using another Git client, which I strongly suggest to try. It's [GitKraken][git-kraken].
