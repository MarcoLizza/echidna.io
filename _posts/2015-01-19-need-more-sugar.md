As written some days in a <a title="Reinventing my own wheel" href="http://blog.brainasylum.com/reinventing-my-own-wheel/" target="_blank">previous post</a>, for my current game-engine I chose and used <a title="Squirrel" href="http://www.squirrel-lang.org" target="_blank">Squirrel</a>.

But, in the very last days I stumbled upon <a title="Wren" href="http://munificent.github.io/wren/" target="_blank">Wren</a>.

It's a young language, but it sounds quite promising.

The syntax is quite compact, juicy and expressive (although I miss the ending semi-color). It natively supports concurrence and generators. The embedding API is simple but essential. Apparently, it's <a title="Performance comparison" href="http://munificent.github.io/wren/performance.html" target="_blank">performances</a> beats Lua up, too.

And it's (very) actively developed.

To be honest, the language is certainly **not** production ready since it lacks (among the other things) of a debug/trace API facility. But my engine is, primarily, developed to have fun and experiment&#8230; so, why don't give to this sugar-coated little bird a try?

*( I honestly think I surely will! )*
