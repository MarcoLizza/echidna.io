My plan to post weekly devlog entries seems to have gone awry. Althought I keep tracking my daily thoughts/activities, the process of collecting and organizing them is cumbersome. Also, since I'm still in a somewhat *brainstorm phase* of the projects, the things I write one day can be nonesense the day after. I will (hopefully) improve in the future.

Let's move on.

In this entry I'd like to talk a bit about **shaders**.

Personally, I've been fascinated by [shaders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shader) since they first appeared in the late nineties, when I installed a GPU-powered video-card in my Pentium computer. I liked them from the beginning because they carry along with them some of the magic and the charm of the old-school effects we were used to marvel at during the Commodore days (and I miss them sooo much!). The concept itself is resembles the idea of *copper-list*(1): a sequence of instructions executed in parallel on a dedicate chip.

Fifteen years later or such, they are everywhere... and for a reason. With a handful of instructions one can easily implement some nice visual effects without heavily burdening the CPU.

Among the many, it seems that 2D water shaders are quite a bit popular. Almost everybody seems to be interested in developing and/or using them in their games/demos.

Me included, or at least that's what I thought at first. I will, of course, implement and use a *2D water shader* in the game, if it would be the chance (in fact, originally in this entry I wanted to present in detail an *awesome* fragment-shader, implementing a cute bi-dimensional reflection effect). But I won't be using fragment-shaders just to properly and nicely edulcorate the visual appeal of the game. Most of all, I'll try and exploit them to simulate the kind of effects that the Copper chip did back in the days.

For example, to render **copper-bars**! ;)

Thanks to [ShaderToy](https://www.shadertoy.com/view/MsfBz4), you can see this simple shader in action! ;)

*<sup><a name="copperlist_note">1</a></sup> To be precise, thanks to Amiga memory-mapper I/O, the [Copper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Original_Chip_Set#Copper) was used to achieve a lot of interesting and clever effets. One could even "hack" the hardware and surpass its limits (two notable and common uses were breach the maximum amount of colors and sprites on screen). Coincidentally, also on the C64 a similar result can be achieved, albeit not through a copper-list.*
