Time for a new *devlog* entry. As I expected, I'm late and my proposal to write an-entry-a-week has failed from the very beginning... but with a ten-days-later entry I'm close enough.

Somewhat.

During the [#1GAM](http://onegameamonth.com) gamejam months I adopted [LOVE2D](https://love2d.org/) as *backbone* for my developing needs. I've been pretty much pleased with it<sup>[1](#love2d_note)</sup>, and [Lua](https://lua.org) is a powerful and nice scripting language that I really like to use.

However, I wasn't very at ease in developing the whole game with a scripting language. In fact, **LOVE2D** is more a *framework* rather than a *game-engine*. It seems just plain wrong to me to write critical game-logic parts (e.g. collision detection, path-finding, scene switching just to mention some of them) in plain script language. It's not something that benefits from rapid script tweaking, but something that need to be coded in the fastest and more robust way ready to be used when needed (e.g. developed in C++ and exposed to the script-side of the engine with a suitable API to interact with).

For a while I considered developing yet another custom engine of mine, but I knew how it would have ended. Even by using a ready-to-integrate state-of-the-art multimedia framework ([SMFL](https://sfml.org)) and a rock-solid scripting language ([Lua](https://lua.org)), the time spent in working with the engine will rapildy overtake the one for the actual game itself.

Stripping the engine to it's bare minimum with the strictly necessary complexity to handle the game requirements, almost reducing it to a custom game-engine tangled and tailored with the actual game itself (much like games in the the eighties and ealry nineties were done), is a a valid option. But how would I take on other aspects such as the porting ot the game to other platforms? I'm mainly a Windows user, but I'd like my game to be ported to other platforms. While I could assume to adapt the engine for Linux, MacOS is definitely out of the league (I don't own a personal development Apple computer, and I don't intend to explore more the Hackintosh side of the computing world).

I really do like coding game engines. Probably in a couple of months I would have a working prototypal engine. But my primary aim is to develop and (most importantly) *complete* a game in the scarce time I can distil.

Despite not being a fan of third-party engine (and libraries), preferring to write and exploit mine as much as possible for a number of factors, I began to consider to use one of them. Something with a reasonable learning curve, and that might come handy as a rapid prototyping tool when required<sup>[2](#in_the_end)</sup>. Point is, there are really too many of them to choose from, so I started to check them one by one.

I can easily exlude [Unity](https://unity3d.com/) and [Unreal Engine](https://www.unrealengine.com) a-priori. They are just too enormous and over-powered for my needs. Also, I feared that I needed to spend way too much time in learning on how to use them rather than working on the game itself. [Yoyo Games' GameMaker Studio 2](http://www.yoyogames.com/gamemaker) seems a valid choice, being a complete IDE that cover almost every aspect of the game-development. Initially I liked it, but after some experimentations I found it cumbersome to use, with a very disperive and unintuitive user-interface (and also the scripting language just doesn't cut the mustard, due to my coding habits).

After quite a long research<sup>[2](#other_engines)</sup>, I found [Godot](https://godotengine.org). It's still not very famous, but it's quite promising. It's very light as a tool, the UI is decently structured, it features a Python-like script language (with C# support in the making), it can be extended with C++ developed modules, it supports both 2D and 3D, can export projects to all the major platforms... and it's completely open. On the bad side, the documentation is a bit lacky... but it is very actively developed and it's has a fast growing community of users and supporters.

For the moment, no commercial games have been developed with Godot, but that's going definitely to change.

*( We'll be back after a short break )*

*<sup><a name="love2d_note">1</a></sup> Although I think that it would definitely benefit from switching from SDL to SFML. Also, updating Lua to 5.3 is something I would consider, even if Luajit is not available for it.*

*<sup><a name="in_the_end">2</a></sup> That means I could end up writing my own engine for the game, if the game it's worth the effort.*

*<sup><a name="other_engines">3</a></sup> Other valid alternatives I found were [Xenko](http://xenko.com/), [Defold](http://www.defold.com/), and [Atomic Game Engine](https://www.atomicgameengine.com/).*
