In the second half of 2016 I dropped [1GAM](http://onegameamonth.com/).

Not because of the gamejam itself being uninteresting (quite the contrary, as Kristen is an amazing guy doing a great good job in motivating the participants and keeping the community alive), but due to my daily duties that kept messing up with my time schedule. Finding constant time to work and complete the monthly task grew more and more difficult each month.

I would have liked to be consistent with every month task but that was pretty much impossible. Over the course of months it rapidly became desolating. To make matters worse, I'm a perfectionist and I could barely stand the *modest-to-law* quality of my projects, rapidly decreasing over the time due to the time constraint.

So, I began thinking about working on a project with a different scope. Something that doesn't need rapid prototyping, but would benefit from a constant and diluted work. And, perhaps, over the course of a year or so. I found that working on a slower pace soothing and extremely rewarding.

Staring from now I will try and redact a weekly devlog, to describe the different aspects of the development process as I face them.
