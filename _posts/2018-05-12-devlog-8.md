# Prologue

Ready for another [#30daydev](https://itch.io/jam/30daydev) round. So far, in the previous 30 days, I managed to (almost) complete the simple pixel-art for the game. I've been studying the game internals and I began designing the game structure accordingly. The current code-base is voluntarily kept at the bare minimum, with no over-engineering.

Within the end of this round, I aim to complete the game AI, leaving the final touches for the next month.

## Day #1 (2018-05-12)

Worked on two very important parts of the game, that is the **actors management system** and the **animation manager**. Both have been implemented as generic as possible, in order to be pretty much reusable in future projects.

The interesting part for the **AMS** module is the adoption of a deferred spawn/kill policy. That is, when a new actor is to be added/ removed from the set, it is at first stored in a table. Later, during the updating step, the actor is moved from/to the active actors' list (an optional event callback is called for the actor to perform additional operations). The list is, then, sorted by priority in order to eventually draw the actors with the proper z-order. Perhaps, I'll be revising this in the near future in favour of a more versatile and generic method.

For the animation module, the interesting part is how the animation modes are implemented. With a scripting language such as Lua once can use closures and functions as first-class-citizens to implement an iterator(s) capable of handling different cases in a smart way, keeping the main module readable.

```lua
-- `t` is the frames' index table, that traces the drawing order.
-- `mode` is a string value indicating the animation mode.
local function iterator(t, mode)
  local i = 0
  local n = table.getn(t)
  local d = 1
  if mode == 'loop' then
    return function()
        i = i + 1
        if i == n + 1 then
          i = 1
        end
        return t[i]
      end
  elseif mode == 'bounce' then
    return function()
        i = i + d
        if (d > 0 and i == n) or (d < 0 and i == 1) then
          d = -d
        end
        return t[i]
      end
  elseif mode == 'once' then
    return function()
        i = i + 1
        if i == n + 1 then
          return nil
        end
        return t[i]
      end
  end
end
```
