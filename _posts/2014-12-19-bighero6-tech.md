It's Christmas time... and the latest traditional Disney's (ehm, Pixar's) movie is coming to town!

Pixar's is well known for introducing a new technology in every new movie. **BigHero6** makes no exception.

Being a CGI enthusiast myself for a long time (still keeping Foley-vanDam right on my bedside table), I dwelled into its the [technical aspects][1]. It's worth reading.

The good old *RenderMan* time has come, in favour of the brand new *Hyperion*. And we all should be pleased with the results.
