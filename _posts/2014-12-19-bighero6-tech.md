It&#8217;s Christmas time&#8230; and the latest traditional Disney&#8217;s (ehm, Pixar&#8217;s) movie is coming to town!

Pixar&#8217;s is well known for introducing a new technology in every new movie. **BigHero6** makes no exception.

Being a CGI enthusiast myself for a long time (still keeping Foley-vanDam right on my bedside table), I dwelled into its the [technical aspects][1]. It&#8217;s worth reading.

The good old *RenderMan* time has come, in favour of the brand new *Hyperion*. And we all should be pleased with the results.
