Video-gaming isn't just an entertaining and amusing (and, alas, time-consuming) activity.

Quite often video-games brings  some of the most advanced and cutting-edge technologies to us, both in hardware and software. Most frequently people don't even realize that.

The Commodore Amiga was a pretty amazing and (somewhat) underrated platform. Custom chipset oriented architecture, an ahead-of-times operative-system and point-and-click interface&#8230; and, last but not least, some of the most ground-breaking games (often exploiting some of the Amiga's peculiar features, such as the Blitter).

**Another World (Out Of This World)** is certainly a classic &#8220;must play&#8221;. I strongly suggest you to grab and buy the remake for the platform of your choice (be it PC, console, or smartphone).
