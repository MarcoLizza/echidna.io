# Prologue

It's been really a while since the last time I wrote a blog entry. Well, it's been a while also since the last time I dedicated myself to a *gamedev* project. Many real-life duties and shenanigans kept my time and attention from being spent on development (in general). Now it seems that the storm has passed, and I can recall myself to funner duties. And what's better than a [#30daydev](https://itch.io/jam/30daydev) project to re-train my indiedev muscles?

I'm not going to elaborate a lot each. It's going to be much like a diary-like (mega)entry.

# Day #0 (2018-04-10)

Occurred to me that I never developed my own *Pac-Man* clone. Need to fix this ASAP. It will be cute exercise in basic *AI* development and group behaviour.

[LÖVE](https://love2d.org/) finally reached a new milestone, and the *v11.0* version has been released. I will definitely use this engine/framework for this project.

Scanning once again through [Jamey Pittman’s "Pac-Man Dossier"](http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/3938/the_pacman_dossier.php). Will use it as a reference for the development. That's quite a lot of information to digest.

# Day #1 (2018-04-11)

For study purposes I (partially) watched [Jamey Pittman's *Perfect Game*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuoH0vz3Mqk). It's astonishing the tactics and the strategies that have been discovered and implemented over the years. A casual watcher could think the player to be without any clue, because of the weird movements and pauses. Not even close.

The ghosts' AIs are the single most important part of the game. Problem is that if I intend to create a proper *remake* I would also be implementing their faulty behaviours (such as, for example, Pinky's and Inky's when Pac-Man is facing upward).

There are a lot of [minor details](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7-SHTktjJc) that could be easily missed, such as the fact that the ghosts and Pac-Man has different speeds when turning a corner (the ghosts appears to "wait" a bit... but how much long is this "bit"?). Should the *kill-screen* worth implementing? Will the *safe areas* emerge automatically if the AI is properly implemented?

Tomorrow I'll start and draw some placeholder sprites in order to set the game area up.

# Day #2 (2018-04-23)

Still studing [Jamey Pittman’s "Pac-Man Dossier"](http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/3938/the_pacman_dossier.php). The sheer amount of detail in this document is amazing. The lack of a "real" path-finding algorithm (e.g. Dijkstra) is neat. With a simple euclidan distance calculation and by setting a priority to movement directions once can be easily fooled that a shortest-route algorithm is applied. Can't wait to implement this as see it in action!

Started by drawing the maze graphic (using Pico-8 palette, which I like very much).

I proceeded in tweaking the colors a bit. I'm not displeased by the result.

Tomorrow I'll be drawing the sprites. I'm wondering whether the pellets and fruits should be rendered as *sprites* or as layered tiles over the background tiles. I suppose the original game used tiles, since sprites where not for free and very limited. Also, handling them as tiles seems convenient and easy enough.

# Day #3 (2018-04-13)

Ditched sprites to work a bit more with the maze graphics. I've been separating the proper maze design from the pellets (which are now on a separate layer). Also, I added a "support" layer to flag the cells and encode the specific behaviour.

To answer the question I posed yesterday to myself, I checked the [Namco Pac-man arcade board specifications](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Namco_Pac-Man). The amount of available sprites is very limited (eight) and their size is 16x16 pixels. The rest of the display is generated a an 8x8 tiles backgorund. We can safely conclude that the pellets are rendered by means tiles, while the fruits are sprites (in addition to Pac-Man and the ghosts).

I'm debated on the most practical way to represent the maze flags. Of course the maze itself is small, and a source-code encoded representation won't pose any difficulty. Nevertheless, I'll prefer a more sleek and faster-to-handle way. Perhaps a raster bitmap color-representation?

Now that the maze is (mostly) complete, I should really prepare some sprites...

# Day #4 (2018-04-14)

*TBD*
