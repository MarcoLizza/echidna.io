# Prologue

It's been really a while since the last time I wrote a blog entry. Well, it's been a while also since the last time I dedicated myself to a *gamedev* project. Many real-life duties and shenanigans kept my time and attention from being spent on development (in general). Now it seems that the storm has passed, and I can recall myself to funner duties. And what's better than a #30daydev project to re-train my indiedev muscles?

I'm not going to elaborate a lot each. It's going to be much like a diary-like (mega)entry.

# Day #0 (2018-04-10)

Occurred to me that I never developed my own *Pac-Man* clone. Need to fix this ASAP. It will be cute exercise in basic *AI* development and group behaviour.

*Love2D* finally reached a new milestone, and the *v11.0* version has been released. I will definitely use the engine/framework for this project.

Scanning once again through [Jamey Pittmanâ€™s "Pac-Man Dossier"](http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/3938/the_pacman_dossier.php). Will use it as a reference for the development. That's quite a lot of information to digest.
