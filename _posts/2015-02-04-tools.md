One should always be open to try new tools, even if satisfied with his/hers.

In the last weeks I found some interesting stuff I would like to share. Don't know if I'm going to keep using them over the long period, but it's worth experimenting.

**Elementary OS**

It's been a while I've been using [Ubuntu][1] (on a virtual machine) for occasional development needs. I kind like the user-interface, but I find it a little over-polluted with effects (although they can be disabled). In some way it feels *slow*.

I evaluated [Mint][2] and other lighter distributions, but they where just *too* lightweight for me.

Then, I stumbled upon [Elementary OS][3]. Despite being still in beta (I'm using [Freya][4]), it seems quite promising. It won't be long that I will switch to it definitely.

**Atom**

[PSPad][5] has been my non-IDE editor for quite some time (being Visual Studio my IDE of choice). It's a nice editor and it integrates well with Windows (and only with this OS), but there were occasion when I'd liked something more tweakable.

I tried [Sublime Text][6] some time ago, but it didn't caught my full attention.

A couple of days ago, by chance, I found out that *Github* developed a great programmers editor, namely [Atom][7]. Good grief, it's really neat!

Hackable and tweakable to the roots, with (of course) *integrated Git support*: it's one of the best editors I ever used!

( and it's also available on Linux, yay! )

**Github for Windows**

If you've ever tried [Atlassian's SourceTree][8] you know that using Git is not necessarily a frustrating and weird experience (excluding the fact that recently it seems to be very slow).

I'm quite satisfied in using it.

Someone at Github must have thought they should develop their own UI-driven client for Git, and here's the result.

It's a nice application with a very clean interface ([ReactiveUI][9] does a great job, here)... 'though it lacks of some very useful features, such as *network view*, and generally it doesn't feel as user-friendly as it seems at first glance.

I'll keep evaluating, waiting for upcoming releases. In the meantime, I'll continue using SourceTree.

**WriteMonkey**

Is was searching for a simple *markdown-to-word* converter and discovered [this little perl][10].

A distraction-less writing application with some solid features (although a *preview* mode is missing).

**Code Compare**

If you're searching a good and affordable comparison tool with a nice interface, [search no more][11].

The free version is feature-loaded and in nicely integrates with Visual Studio (which is a plus for me).

Not as good and fast as [Araxis Merge][12] (which is a commercial-only product), and with a not so clean interface. But certainly worth the try!
