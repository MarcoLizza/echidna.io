This is quite a geeky day for programmers. I suppose I don't need to tell you why... but in the case, check today's date and think of it as power-of-twos. ;)

Anyway, I just found the time to update the Windows CE porting of Lua to the latest version.

Please note that I've decided to drop CodePlex... so so grab it [here][1]! :)
