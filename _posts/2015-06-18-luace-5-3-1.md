The latest version of Lua has been released. As usual, the Windows CE porting has been updated.

This is a bug-fix release of version 5.3, aiming to solve the following problems

  * `string.format("%f")` can cause a buffer overflow (only when `lua_Number` is long double!).
  * `debug.getlocal` on a coroutine suspended in a hook can crash the interpreter.
  * Suspended `__le` metamethod can give wrong result.
  * Return hook may not see correct values for active local variables when function returns.

Go grab it [here][1]Â (or [here][2])!
