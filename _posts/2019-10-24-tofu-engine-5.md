Pulling pixels is something I always liked to to. Since the mid-'90s, when  I've been writing several libraries/APIs (mostly for personal use)

In 1995 (circa) I put my hands on my first PC. I've been using Commodore home-computer (C64 first, then the Amiga) since my early childhood, and my programming experience was based on them.

Of course my first interest was how to pull pixels on the screen and VGA's Mode-13h was something really easy to understand and use. After years of using some very elaborated and custom chips (I'm talking about you, VIC-II and Agnus) with very specific and peculiar features, facing something so simple and w/o any interesting feature was... strange.

Not only I had to re-learn pretty much everything about a platform (the PC) which seemed to devoid of features, but I also had to learn how to implement every graphics feat I needed.
