In the last month I've completed what can safely be called *the first milestone*: `v0.1.0`.

Starting from the idea of a *lo-fi* 2D game-engine I reached the point of having some (scripted) sprites bouncing of the screen. Also, basic drawing primitives has been implemented along with text drawing. Once picked the media library and the scripting language it has been just a matter of organizing some code, which has been straightforward (although there's still need for abstraction and better modularization, but this will come over time).

## Embedding API

## Palette support
